/**
 * Helper macros to allow function overloading even when using
 * std::shared_ptr.
 *
 * shared_ptr makes overloading really annoying, since shared_ptr defines
 * constructor methods to allow one shared_ptr type to be constructed from any
 * other shared_ptr type.  (Even if it would be a compile error to actually try
 * to instantiate the constructor.)  These macros add an extra argument to the
 * function to cause it to only be instantiated if a pointer of type T is
 * convertible to a pointer of type Y.
 *
 * THRIFT_OVERLOAD_IF should be used in function declarations.
 * THRIFT_OVERLOAD_IF_DEFN should be used in the function definition, if it is
 * defined separately from where it is declared.
